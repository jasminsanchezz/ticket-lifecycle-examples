<h1> OsTicket - Ticket Lifecycle Example </h1> 

<h2> Description </h2>
A ticket lifecycle is the process a support request goes through from start to finish. First, a user submits their issue, and it gets assigned to the right team to handle. The team looks into the problem, communicates with the user if needed, and works on solving it. Once the issue is fixed, the ticket is closed, and the user is informed of the resolution. This helps ensure the problem is addressed quickly and effectively.
